/**
 * @title    Registry
 * @notice   A contract which is essentially a glorified forwarder.
 *           It essentially brings together people who want things executed,
 *           and people who want to do that execution in return for a fee.
 *           Users register the details of what they want executed, which
 *           should always revert unless their execution condition is true,
 *           and executors execute the request when the condition is true.
 *           Only a specific executor is allowed to execute requests at any
 *           given time, as determined by the StakeManager, which requires
 *           staking AUTO tokens. This is infrastructure, and an integral
 *           piece of the future of web3. It also provides the spark of life
 *           for a new form of organism - cyber life. We are the gods now.
